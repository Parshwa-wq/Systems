# Systems Repository

Welcome to the **Systems Repository**! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains a collection of different systems built using **Java**. The goal of this repository is to provide a wide range of system examples for educational purposes, development practice, and hands-on learning.

Here, you'll find various applications ranging from **Bank Management Systems**, **Student Grade Trackers**, **Inventory Management Systems**, **Employee Data Management**, and more.

## Purpose

The systems in this repository are designed to:
- Demonstrate core Java programming concepts.
- Show best practices for organizing and structuring Java applications.
- Provide useful examples for real-world software development tasks.
- Help learners and developers improve their skills by working with complete, functional projects.

## Available Systems

The repository will contain various Java-based systems that can be downloaded and run locally. Some of the systems youâ€™ll find here include:

- **Bankingapp**  
  A system to manage bank accounts, transactions, deposits, and withdrawals.
  
- **Student Grade Tracker**  
  Track student grades, calculate averages, and generate reports.
  
- **Shopping List Tracker**  
  Create and manage shopping lists, calculate total prices, and categorize items.

- **Employee Data Management**  
  Manage employee records, payrolls, attendance, and performance reviews.

The repository will continue to grow as more systems are added. Please feel free to contribute or suggest new systems to be included!

## File Structure

Each system will be organized in its own directory and include:
- **README.md**: Instructions on how to set up and use the system.
- **Source code (Java)**: All the relevant code files for the system.
